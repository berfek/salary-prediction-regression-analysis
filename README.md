# Salary Prediction with Regression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Python project focused on predicting salaries using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, encoding, linear regression modeling, polynomial features, and evaluation. It aims to provide insights into salary predictions based on employment data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Linear Regression Modeling**: Building a linear regression model to predict salaries.
- **Polynomial Features**: Expanding the feature space using polynomial features to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 score.

## Technologies Used
- Python (with libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berfek/salary-prediction-regression-analysis.git
